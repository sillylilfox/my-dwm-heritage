What is this?
  -Kitkat is a fun status tool i made while eating kitkat
  -Again, you are free to use and configure it based on your needs.

Why are so many functions broken or not implemented yet?
  -I only implemented the functions i use. If you can add some other functionalities, do so.

How to use it?
  - kitkat <output> <delay> <format string>
  an example:
  ```kitkat stdout 1 "%b|%c|%r"```

Any plans towards working on it?
  -Not really. But i am planning towards starting to use dwm again. Maybe more polished versions will be available.
